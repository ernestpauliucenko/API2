API Coding Challenge 2

1&2.py authenticates with api-playground and gets the menu
3.py fetches the Dinner category from the weborder API
4.py fetches the Red Sparkling product from the weborder API
5.py calculates the order total and prints the final total

For convenience, the "requests" third-party library was used.

NOTE: The getres function is only defined to provide realistic request validation.
I realize that defining a single-use function in this case is a bit unnecessary.
